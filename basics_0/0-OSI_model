What is the OSI model?

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and design how different networking protocols interact across seven layers.

How is the OSI model organized?

The OSI model is organized into seven layers:

1. Physical Layer: Responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium.
2. Data Link Layer: Handles node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
3. Network Layer: Manages routing and forwarding of data.
4. Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer between hosts.
5. Session Layer: Manages sessions or connections between applications.
6. Presentation Layer: Translates data formats and handles encryption.
7. Application Layer: Provides network services directly to user applications.
